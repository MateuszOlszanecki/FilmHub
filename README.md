# FilmHub

It is a mobile web application that stores films that you watched and want to watch in the future.
It uses Firebase Database to store all records. You can remove film or check the checkbox on a film that you already watched.

You can tick the box and that means you watched the film. You can add new film and search existing one.
If you add new film it will automaticly align the screen so that this new film is on the top:
